#Data Description


---
## Data Description
### What is the Data?
The data recorded each individuals' body fat percentage and other measurement about the body.
The study subjects of the dataset are 250 adult males, which almost covers every age.

### When was this data taken?
24 Jun 2008

### Where did we take this?
We take this dataset from Dr.A. Garth Fisher, who generously supplied this and  gave permission to freely distribute the data and use it for non-commercial purposes. 
---
## Data Description
### Measured 16 variables
density, age, height, weight, %body fat,  neck circumference and other ten  various body circumferences.

```{r, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sjPlot)
library(caret)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggfortify)
data = read_tsv("bodyfat.txt")
data = read_tsv("bodyfat.txt")
## Data cleaning 
## Change Height from inches to cm by 
data$Height <- data$Height*2.54

## Change weight from pounds to kg
data$Weight <-  data$Weight/2.20462
max(data$Weight)
```

## Data Description

.font160[Measure % body fat directly is not easy   →  use Siri’s equation to predict it]

### Hypothesis
.font180[
$$
H_0:\beta_i = 0
$$

$$
H_1:\beta_i>0, \beta_i<0, \beta_i \neq 0
$$
]

### Assumption
The residuals $\epsilon_i$ are iid $N(0, σ^2)$, and there is a linear relationship between some attributes and body fat.

### Conclusion
Reject if the p-value is less than the level of significance, $\alpha$

# Assumption Checking

## Checking for Linearity and normality
```{r, include=FALSE}
data = data %>% mutate(lresid = step.fwd.aic$residuals)
```

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
autoplot(Final, which = 1:2)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
p1 = ggplot(data,
aes(x = Waist, y = Pct.BF)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

p11 = ggplot(data, aes(x = Waist, y = lresid)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +labs(y = "Residuals")+ geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

Apart from a few points in the lower and upper tail, the majority of the points lie very close to the diagonal line in the QQ plot. Hence, the normality assumption for the residuals is well satisfied. 
On the other hand, based on the Central Limit Theorem, the sample size is large enough that most of the points would follow the normal distribution.
---
## Checking for Linearity
```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggarrange(p1,p11, labels = c("A","B"), ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

---
## Checking for Linearity
```{r, include = FALSE}
p2 = ggplot(data, aes(x = Weight, y = Pct.BF)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

p22 = ggplot(data, aes(x = Weight, y = lresid)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +labs(y = "Residuals")+ geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```


```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggarrange(p2,p22, labels = c("A","B"), ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```


---
## Checking for Linearity

```{r, include = FALSE}
p3 = ggplot(data,
aes(x = Wrist, y = Pct.BF)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

p33 = ggplot(data, aes(x = Wrist, y = lresid)) +
geom_point(size = 1) + theme_classic(base_size = 20) +labs(y = "Residuals")+ geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```


```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggarrange(p3,p33, labels = c("A","B"), ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```


As we can see from the multiple scatter plots of variables in the final model, the variables all meet the requirement for linearity. Residuals of each variable is symmetrically distributed above and below zero. A curved pattern in the residuals does not show up. Which means there is no overestimation and underestimation.

---
.font160[
# Checking for Independece
]

Since the 250 samples are sampled from various ages and independently. We can assume that each of them are independent.

.font160[
# Checking for Homoskedasticity
]

By checking the residual plots of each variable of the final model above, we can see that the spread looks constant over the range of each variable value. Which we can confirm the homoskedasticity for each variable.

## Discussion of results

### What does the results say in relation to rejection of null hypothesis?
