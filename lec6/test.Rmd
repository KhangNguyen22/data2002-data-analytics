## Plot bill length against depth

```{r}
penguins %>% ggplot() +
  aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se= FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = species),method="lm", se= FALSE) 
# Use geom_point to plot the points on scatterplot, geom_smooth to find the regressional line

```
# Need to consider the confounding factors for the above graph
 Individual groups we get to see the trend, but combined the correlation looks negative.
